        "Add the meat to the wet cure and let it sit for another 2 hours flipping twice to make sure it's evenly covered in the liquid.",
        "Do this in a clean plastic or non-reactive metal container where the meat fits snugly.",

         
        "While the meat is marinating make the spice mix. Toast the spices, apart from the peppercorns, in a dry pan until fragrant and",

        ingredients: [
          'Meat - Beef Mince. Sometimes Mutton or a mix of mutton and beef are used. Make sure to get good quality mince with 20% fat maximum if buying the mince.',
          'When grinding your own meat, the best cuts to use are chuck, rump and brisket.',
          
          'Fat - We use butter to fry the onions, but you can also use neutral oil or the fat that renders from cooking the mince.',
          'Aromatics - Onion as well as garlic and ginger paste makes up the base of the dish.',
          'Worcestershire sauce - Naturally fermented and a huge flavour enhancer. If you do not have it, use a touch of soy sauce and a bit of vinegar.',
          'Tomato paste - Another essential ingredient for making the best Bobotie possible. It adds richness and depth of flavour to the base, which is super important.',
          'Chutney - Apricot chutney is a must. Make your own chilli apricot chutney, or use a good store bought version.',
          'Spices - Curry powder, extra ginger and turmeric plus a few bay leaves to place on top before baking.',
          'Raisins - I used a mix of raisins and sultanas, but you could use any or simply omit it if you do not like raisins.',
          'Eggs mix - Consists of eggs and milk. If you want it richer, replace with cream or half-half (half milk, half cream).',

          'Once browned, you drain the mince through a sieve to remove or reserve the rendered fat.',
          
          'Next, you fry the onions along with the garlic and ginger paste in butter or the rendered fat from the meat.',
          'Cook it slowly and make sure not to caramelise the onions. It is ok if it browns a bit but adjust the balance accordingly as caramelised onions are sweeter.',
          'Once the onions are soft, add the spices apart from the ginger powder along with the raisins. Cook it for a few seconds on low heat just to combine. Add the tomato paste and chutney,',
          'then cook for a further minute until the tomato paste has lost its rawness.',

          'Whisk together the egg and milk, then pour it over the meat. Decorated with a few bay leaves as per tradition, if you wish. Brush the leaves with water to avoid burning.',
          'Place the dish into an oven tray filled with boiling water. This is optional, but will keep the edges from caramelising too much. Some like it that way, so do what you fancy.',
          ' Bake for 35 minutes, then serve.',
